# Fiat_500e_Brodit_Mount

This is a Brodit Proclip like mount for the Fiat 500e.

It is designed to be attached on the right side so as to not block the AC buttons. I used some double sided adhesive 3W foam pads to make the fit more secure.

There are three M3 holes. I used the to attach a multimove clip to it, so I can the attached phone mount easily. Picture shows as MagSafe mount.

Printed using PET, 75% infill, Quarter Bicubic Infill, 1.8mm Walls.
